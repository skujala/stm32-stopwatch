STM32 BASED SPEED MEASURING FIRMWARE
====================================


This project aims to create a firmware to be uploaded in STM32VLDiscovery device, which allows to measure the time a falling object falls in a copper pipe. Pipe is fitted with two IR LED and phototransistor pairs, which initiate and terminate the timing. The purpose of dropping objects through a copper (good conductor) pipe is to demonstrate in a physics lecture the effect of eddy currents - a permanent magnet falling freely through a conducting pipe induces eddy currents in the pipe, which according to Lenz's law act to oppose the changing magnetic field and thereby slowing down the permanent magnet.

The timing is based on STM32's TIMER functionality.
